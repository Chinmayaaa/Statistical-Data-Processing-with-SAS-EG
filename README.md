# Statistical-Data-Processing-with-SAS-EG
Objective: analyze sample data set for statistical dependencies. 9 Variables were analyzed
From the analysis above, the following were observed: 
1.	The population is not ageing as a lot of the population is between 29 and 42.
2.	Only few persons pursued higher education degrees beyond the high school degree.
3.	Very few members of the population earned higher than the rest of the population.
4.	Job mobility is high as only few stay longer at a particular work place. 
5.	Many people in the population are in debt.
6.	About 29% of the population defaulted on loans.
7.	Younger people had more defaults on loans. There are prevailing factors peculiar with the young: fashion, compulsive Disorder e.g. : shopaholics, little or no stable employment, loan seeking for education, misplaced or misguided priorities, and social factors.
8.	We also noticed that the number of people who defaulted on loans were more among those with a college degree (22 out of 30: 73%). Moreover, this was expected, as there is currently a rise in college loan debts among college students.
9.	People with larger incomes had lower debts (negative correlation between income and debt to income ratio).
10.	As debit to income ratio increased, there was a tendency for credit card debt to rise too.
11.	As income increased, there is a tendency for credit card debt to rise too. People with more money rend to spend more with credit cards, as the bank places a higher limit on the amount of money they can spend on their credit cards given the fact that their higher income is a guarantee they will pay back.
12.	As income increased, there is a decrease in the default on loans.
13.	As income increased, there is an increase in other debts. More income earners spend more and incur more debts.
